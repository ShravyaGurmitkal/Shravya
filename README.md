I'm a person who loves problem solving and thinks to write good and efficient code. I am flexible and can adapt to new technologies easily.

I have completed my graduation in computer science stream in India and has worked for 2years as EDI Developer. Also trained on different technologies like Python, SQL, Java. I want to change my carrer as a full stack developer, so I have joined Hack Your Future bootcamp after coming to Denmark where I have learnt frontend development.
